# BigGAN Image Generator

This is a Python script that uses the BigGAN model from TensorFlow Hub to generate images. The script generates a random noise vector, passes it through the BigGAN model, and saves the resulting image to a file.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- TensorFlow Hub
- Pillow

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash 
pip install tensorflow tensorflow_hub pillow
```


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/biggan-image-generator.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory using the following command:

```bash
cd image-generator-discord-bot
cd image-generator
```

3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python generator.py
```

4. The script will generate an image and save it to a file named `generated_image.jpg` in the same directory.

## Customization

You can customize the script to generate images with different styles and resolutions by modifying the input noise vector and the BigGAN model. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import tensorflow_hub as hub
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

# Load the BigGAN model
model = hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/biggan-256/2")

# Generate a noise vector with a specific seed
np.random.seed(123)
z = np.random.normal(size=[1, 128]).astype(np.float32)

# Generate an image from the noise vector
image = model(z)['default'][0]

# Convert the image to a Pillow Image object
image = Image.fromarray(np.uint8(image*255))

# Save the image to a file
image.save('generated_image.jpg')

```

In this example, we generate a noise vector with a specific seed to ensure that the image is reproducible. You can modify the seed or generate the noise vector in other ways to create different images.
